## Target audience

Kids in 5th and 6th grade.

## Authoring

Authoring material is in `authoring`, with .fla and ActionScript files (`scripts/org/siriux`).

### Adding more players

The code supports any number of players, but additional tracks need to be created for each one. Since the track is curved, it's best to create these paths manually to avoid having player pieces overlapping each other.
